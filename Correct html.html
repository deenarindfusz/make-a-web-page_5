       <p >We learned a lot about how Markup uses <em>tags, elements, attributes, and sources </em> to create our webpage.<br>
       HTML tags are code that describe how a web page is formatted. They are defined by the characters inside a set of brackets. 
       Most tags come in a set of 2, an opening tag &lt; &gt;and a closing tag &lt; / &gt;.<br>
       Elements are compiled of opening tags, content and closing tags.<br>
       Attributes provide additional information about an element.<br>
       Source elements are used to define the media resource for your pictures and videos.<br>
       We touched on inline and block tags along with Span and Div elemements but we"ll learn more about those later.4&gt;
       We also learned that if we can't remember all the tags go to <a href="http://www.Google.com"> <b>GOOGLE</b></a>

       <b>HTML Document Structure</b>
       <div class="Topic-description" > 
        <p> HTML documents are made up of more than tags.  They contain a head and body sections. The head contains metadata and other random stuff. <br> 
        The body contains all the actual contents of the document. This diagram shows the structure of an HTML Document.<br>
        <br><em>
"<div>Domestic Object Module (DOM Tree) </em><br>

        <br>         
        <br>Before you start to code your website, visualize what you want it to look like. <br>
">Draw it out on a piece of paper to get an idea of what it will look like. <br>
        This way you can make sure the site will look like you want it.<br> <b>Remember to </b><em><b><u>View it</u> </b></em> before <em><b><u>You do it</u></b>.</em></p>

         <br><br>
Boxes - everything on your website will be in a box. You have boxes inside of boxes. Things that don't look like a box are a box.
         <br>By selecting different attributes of the box you can change how the box looks. It can look like a circle, rectangle or triangle.

      <h4><b> CSS Styling in HTML</b></h4>
      <div class="Topic-Decription" >
        <p>CSS styling is what is used to select the color, size and styles of the website. It sets the Font color and size, if text is bold or italic. 
        <br>It sets the shape and color of objects that are loaded into the webite. This is done using attributes and selectors. 
        <br> Beware of repetition. Repetition is repeating code in places where it has no meaning/value. This makes it difficult to read and troubleshoot what should actually be happening.
        <br>
        <br>3 things you need to remember when coding:
        </p><ul><li>Code - Avoid Repetition. </li>
        <li> Test - Test your code for errors</li>
        <li>
        Refine - Correct any errors that found</li>
        </ul>CSS is a powerful tool. Don't be afraid to play and experiment to find out which styles you want to use on your website.
